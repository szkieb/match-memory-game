# Memory Game

A basic memory/matching pairs game built using JavaScript, Parcel and (very little) Tailwind. 

One of my earliest attempts at using JavaScript.  

## Rules of the game
This is a Memory Game aka Matching Pairs aka Concentration, or alternatively Shinkei-suijaku (Japanese meaning "nervous breakdown").
Pick a card, any card, pick another card, try to find a match. If you fail to find a match, your opponent goes next. Repeat. Win.
